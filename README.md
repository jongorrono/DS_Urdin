I'm Jon Gorroño, a designer who bridges the gap between technical complexity and human experience. With 10+ years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex systems into simple, intuitive, and visually compelling products.

My unique background—an IT degree from Deusto and a Master's in Design from Barcelona—allows me to design with a developer's mindset and code with a designer's eye. I've delivered digital products, design systems, and UX strategies for global corporations (Inditex/ZARA, Gestamp), agile startups, and public institutions.

I believe design has the power to make technology effortless and enjoyable—turning challenges into solutions that truly work for people.
